# CyVerse_Variant_Analyses
Scripts and data for the February 5th, 2021 webinar dealing with Variant Call Analyses with CyVerse presented by Jacob Landis.

Important note. Some of the input data files, especially the VCF files, were gzipped to save space and meet upload requirements. These files should be gunzipped before running the analyses. Navigating to the different folders and entering the following command in the terminal for each appropriate folder will allow completion of the tutorial without having to change any file names: gunzip *.vcf.gz

A recording of the webinar is now available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8fzFZQ7AyU&t=1019s
